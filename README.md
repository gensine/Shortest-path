# Shortest-path
# 📍 Dijkstra's Algorithm - Shortest Path Finder

A simple and efficient implementation of **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. This project can be used for routing, navigation systems, network optimization, and graph analysis.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm from scratch
- 🗺️ Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes
- 🧠 Supports both adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations
- 🏁 Displays shortest path and corresponding total cost
- 📈 Optional visualization or step-by-step output (CLI/GUI-based)
- 🔁 Handles disconnected graphs gracefully
- 💡 Easy to integrate into other routing or path-finding applications
